# D3_visualizeRMS
This plot shows the RMS on EMG raw data. The window for RMS can be adapted by the user. As such one can experience the effect of the window size on the resulting filtered output.

To run the project please make sure to have all files in one folder and start a local server inside this folder, e.g. python -m http.server 8080
